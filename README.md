M Files: Source Codes of Computational Intelligence Assisted Design (In the Era of Industry 4.0)

One of the most fundamental issues when proposing an algorithm is to have a standard methodology to test and validate its performance. Test functions, such as convergence speed, precision, robustness and other performance indicators, have been proposed as benchmarks for evaluating the characteristics of optimization algorithms.

Test functions are commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of different search algorithms. However, the results of evaluation are as dependent on the test problems as they are on the algorithms that are subject to comparison.

Basically, the test functions can be divide into 2 types: 
Type-1 (T1), which are test functions for single-objective optimization problems.
Type-2 (T2), which are test functions for multi-objective optimization problems.

Usage:
(1) TF1_*_plot is to plot the fitness function, run it in the MATLAB command line
(2) TF1_* and TF2_* are MATLAB functions
